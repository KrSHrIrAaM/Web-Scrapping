# Odisha RERA Project Scraper

## Overview

This project is a **Python-based web scraper** designed to extract real estate project details from the official **Odisha RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) portal**. It utilizes **Selenium** to automate the process, fetching details such as:
- **Project Name**

- **GST Number**

The extracted data is saved into a **CSV file** for easy access and analysis.

## Features

Handles **dynamic content loading** efficiently  
Extracts **promoter details** after switching tabs  
Saves data to **CSV file** for further use  

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**  
- **CSV module** (for saving extracted data)  

## Experince

I completed this project in 2 hours, during which I faced various challenges and fixes. The thing I found a little bit challenging was making dynamic data scraping. Even though, with the help of Copilot and ChatGPT, I completed the task within the allotted time.
